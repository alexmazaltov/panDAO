# Contract-Based Motivation for Contributions

We do not have a budget to compensate with funds at the moment. However, we offer several contract-based incentives to motivate your contributions. 

### 1. Token Rewards
We can issue tokens as a reward for your contributions. Each completed user story will be evaluated and rewarded accordingly, with each hour of contribution equating to a specific token amount. These tokens can be accumulated and exchanged for various benefits in the future, such as premium features, access to exclusive content, or even future monetary compensation as our project grows.

### 2. Contribution Evaluation
Each user story implemented will be evaluated and credited as one hour of contribution. This ensures a fair and transparent system where your efforts are recognized and rewarded consistently.

### 3. Contract Agreement
You will receive a contract detailing the terms of your contribution, the token reward system, and the evaluation criteria. This contract will ensure clarity and mutual agreement on expectations and rewards.

### 4. Recognition and Reputation
We will highlight top contributors on our project’s website and social media channels. This public recognition can help build your professional reputation and make your contributions stand out in the developer community.

### 5. Skill Development
Contributing to our repository will provide you with the opportunity to work on cutting-edge technology and improve your skills. This hands-on experience can be a great addition to your resume and help you advance your career.

### 6. Networking Opportunities
Join a community of like-minded developers and collaborate on exciting projects. This networking can lead to new job opportunities, partnerships, and collaborations in the tech industry.

### 7. Project Influence
As a contributor, you will have a say in the direction of the project. Your feedback and ideas will be taken seriously, allowing you to shape the future of the project and make a real impact.

### 8. Learning and Mentorship
Gain access to mentorship from experienced developers in our community. Whether you are a novice or an expert, there’s always something new to learn, and we are here to support your growth.

### 9. Exclusive Access
Receive early access to new features and updates. As a contributor, you will be among the first to test and use the latest developments in our project.
